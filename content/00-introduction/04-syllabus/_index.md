### Course Overview

Advanced data structures and related algorithms. Formal software development methods and software engineering fundamentals. Introduction to requirements analysis processes that provide the specification of algorithmic requirements.

### Course Description

This course introduces advanced data structures, such as trees, graphs, and heaps. Several new algorithms using these data structures are covered. Students also learn software development methods and software engineering fundamentals and use those skills to develop projects of increasing size and scope effectively.

### Major Course Topics

* Data Structures
  * Trees
  * Graphs
  * Heaps
* Algorithms
  * Graph Searching
  * Shortest Path
  * Minimal Spanning Tree
* Requirements Analysis
* Application to Domain Areas

###  Course Structure

These courses are being taught 100% online, and each module is self-paced. There may be some bumps in the road as we refine the overall course structure. Students will work at their own pace through a set of modules, with approximately one module being due each week. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, online tutorials, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a coding project or assignment, many of which will be graded automatically through Codio. Assignments may also include portions which will be graded manually via Canvas or other tools.

The assigments for this course is delivered through Python programming language.

All activities are individual effort.  'Group' work is not permitted.

###  Codio

You are expected to use the Codio Editor.  It is deliberately feature poor to place the burden of programming syntax, vocabulary and logic flow on the student.  DO NOT CUT AND PASTE into the editor while coding your projects. 

Exception, you may cut and paste from Codio, so if you accidently delete the starter code, or want to modify a section of code you made in the tutorial.  INCLUDE a comment stating from where you 'sourced' the pasted section.

from Codio tutorial 3.4.P.7
with open(sys.argv[1]) as input_file:

    try:     

        reader = input_file.readlines()

    except:

        reader = sys.stdin


### Grading

In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:

* 70% - Codio Programming Projects
* 30% - Codio Tutorials and Quizzes

Up to 5% of the total grade in the class is available as extra credit. See the **Extra Credit - Bug Bounty** assignment for details.

Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:

* 90% - 100% &rarr; A
* 80% - 89.99% &rarr; B
* 70% - 79.99% &rarr; C
* 60% - 69.99% &rarr; D
* 00% - 59.99% &rarr; F

### How Project Grades are Assigned
The Projects you submit in Codio may have both an automatic and manual grading component.

Automatic Components:  Codio automatically checks certain aspects of your code's structure and functionality.  The grade assigned by Codio is generally the ceiling of the score you can receive.

Manual Components:  Once submitted your code may be reviewed and deductions take for:

Forbidden statements/Required statements: Some assignments may prohibit the use of certain built in functions and methods. Others may require the use of certain libraries and methods.  Using prohibited statements and or skipping required statements will result in a ZERO for the project.

Cutting and Pasting into the Codio IDE (Project assignments): You are expected to do your work in Codio. Cutting and pasting from outside Codio is prohibited,  may result in a zero and will trigger a closer plagiarism review. 

Running from the terminal: Codio does not typically check for proper terminal input behavior. A project that does not compile and/or run from the terminal will result in a 25% reduction in your final score.  The project should work for the sample inputs, and should not crash or print extraneous  information. 

Having extra methods/missing required methods:  up to 10% deduction

### Late Work


{{% notice warning %}}
Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via the help email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won't apply to you!
{{% /notice %}}

Since this course is entirely online, students may work at any time and at their own pace through the modules. However, to keep everyone on track, there will be approximately one module due each week. Each graded item in the module will have a specific due date specified. **All of the components of a module will be subject to the late policy if the module is submitted late. This penalty will be assessed via a single separate assignment entry in the gradebook, containing the sum of all grade reductions in the course for that student. Late assignments will not be accepted if they have been submitted more than 3 days after the due date, unless a special reason is provided and prior approval for an extension has been obtained before the due date.** 


For the purposes of recordkeeping, the submission time of the confirmation quiz in each module will be used to establish the completion time of the entire module in case of a discrepancy. This is because Codio may update submission times when assignments are regraded, but the quiz in Canvas should only be completed once.

However, even if a module is not submitted on time, it must still be completed before a student is allowed to begin the next module. So, students should take care not to get too far behind, as it may be very difficult to catch up.

Finally, all course work must be submitted on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time.

If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to make up missed work.

### Incomplete Policy

Students should strive to complete this course in its entirety before the end of the semester in which they are enrolled. However, since retaking the course would be costly and repetitive for students, we would like to give students a chance to succeed with a little help rather than immediately fail students who are struggling.

If you are unable to complete the course in a timely manner, please contact the instructor to discuss an incomplete grade. Incomplete grades are given solely at the instructor's discretion. See the official [K-State Grading Policy](https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/students/academicpolicy/#GRADING) for more information. In general, _poor time management alone is not a sufficient reason for an incomplete grade_.

Unless otherwise noted in writing on a signed [Incomplete Agreement Form](https://www.k-state.edu/registrar/faculty-staff/forms/Incomplete%20agreement%20form.docx), the following stipulations apply to any incomplete grades given in Computational Core courses:

1. Students may receive at most two incompletes in Computational Core courses throughout their time in the program
2. Students will be given 6 calendar weeks from the end of the enrolled semester's finals week to complete the course
3. Any modules in a future CC course which depend on incomplete work will not be accessible until the previous course is finished
  1. For example, if a student is given an incomplete in CC 210, then all modules in CC 310 will be inaccessible until CC 210 is complete
4. Students understand that access to instructor and GTA assistance may be limited after the end of an academic semester due to holidays and other obligations
5. If a student fails to resolve an incomplete grade after 6 weeks, they will be assigned an 'F' in the course. In addition, they will be dropped from any other Computational Core courses which require the failed course as a prerequisite or corequisite.

### Authorized Aid

All graded work is individual effort. You are authorized  to use:

course's materials,
direct web-links from this course
the appropriate languages documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/  or https://docs.oracle.com/javase/Links to an external site.)
Email help received through  315 help email, CC - Instructors, GTAs
Zoom/In-person help received from Instructors or GTA
ACM help session (an on campus only resource) Most Tuesdays in EH 1116, 6:30PM. 
Tutors from the Academic Assistance Center or provided by K-State Athletics 
Use of on-line solutions whether for reference or code is prohibited.  Use of previous semester's answers, whether your own or another student's is prohibited.  Use of code-completion/suggestion tool's, other than those we have installed in the Codio editor, is prohibitied.

### Work Load
CC-315 is a three-hour course;  most students find it more time consuming than CC-310.

Modules have been assigned so that the average amount of work (hours), based on past student performance, is somewhat consistent. 

You may work ahead, but modules must be worked strictly in order.  Also, if you are far ahead, it may take a bit longer to get help. We review the lessons every week so the support you get is not 'too advanced'; if you are pretty far ahead, we will need to 'catch up' to where you are to provide support.

Please note, modules are not equally weighted, some are worth far more than others. 


### Recommended Texts & Supplies

To participate in this course, students must have access to a modern web browser and broadband internet connection. All course materials will be provided via Canvas and Codio. Modules may also contain links to external resources for additional information, such as programming language documentation.

### Subject to Change

The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.
