In the last module, we covered the underlying vocabulary of trees and how we can implement our own tree. To recall, we covered: node, edge, root, leaf, parent, child, and degree.

For this module we will expand on trees and gain a better understanding of how powerful trees can be. As before, we will use the same tree throughout the module for a guiding visual example.
