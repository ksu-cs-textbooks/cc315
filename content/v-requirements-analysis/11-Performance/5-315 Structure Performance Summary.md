Generic Trees
---

In the following, $n$ denotes the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Insert**: 1 if we have the parent but $n$ if we have to find the parent
- **Access**: 1 if we want to access the root but $n$ otherwise 
- **Find**: $n$
- **Delete**: $n$ if we have to find the parent
- **Memory**: $n$

Tries
---

In the following, $m$ denotes the length of a word and $n$ denotes the number of words in the trie.

- **Insert**: $m$
- **Access**: $m$
- **Find**: $m$
- **Delete**: $m$
- **Memory**: $n\times m$

Binary Trees
---

In the following, $n$ denotes the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Insert**: $log_2(n)$ when balanced but $n$ otherwise
- **Access**: $log_2(n)$ when balanced but $n$ otherwise
- **Find**: $log_2(n)$ when balanced but $n$ otherwise
- **Delete**: $log_2(n)$ when balanced but $n$ otherwise
- **Memory**: $n$
