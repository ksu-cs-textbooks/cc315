    <description>Letâ€™s look at the performance of priority queues next. These structures are based on a heap, which has some unique characteristics related to the heap properties that it must maintain.&#xA;Recall that a heap is an array which we can view as an unsorted binary tree. This tree must have the following properties:&#xA;Each node has at most two children. If there are nodes in level i of the tree, then level i-1 is full.</description>
