    <description>Stacks A stack is a data structure with two main operations that are simple in concept. One is the push operation that lets you put data into the data structure and the other is the pop operation that lets you get data out of the structure.&#xA;A stack is what we call a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure. That means that when we pop a piece of data off the stack, we get the last piece of data we put on the stack.</description>
