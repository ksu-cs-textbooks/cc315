    <title>Module Outline :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/v-requirements-analysis/11-performance/1-module-outline/</link>
    <description>In this module, we will reintroduce the data structures that we have seen and implemented throughout CC315 as well as CC310. We will discuss the running time for various operations as well as space requirements for each structure.&#xA;You may recall that in CC310, we did a similar comparison. We will use most of the same operations from that module so we can draw comparisons between the structures in CC310 and CC315.</description>
