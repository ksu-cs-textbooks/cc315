    <title>315 Structure Performance Summary :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/v-requirements-analysis/11-performance/5-315-structure-performance-summary/</link>
    <description>This page will be devoted to summarizing our performance discussions. Below, we have included a graph for a frame of reference for the various functions.&#xA;Generic Trees In the following, $n$ denotes the number of nodes in the tree.&#xA;Insert: 1 if we have the parent but $n$ if we have to find the parent Access: 1 if we want to access the root but $n$ otherwise Find: $n$ Delete: $n$ if we have to find the parent Memory: $n$ Tries In the following, $m$ denotes the length of a word and $n$ denotes the number of words in the trie.</description>
