    <title>Graphs :: CC 315 Textbook</title>

    <description>There are two types of graphs that we’ve covered in this class: list graphs and matrix graphs. Graphs are slightly different than other data structures, because we may want to find or access both nodes and edges in the graph. So, we’ll need to analyze the performance of graphs with respect to both nodes and edges.&#xA;Matrix Graph Recall that a matrix graph uses an array to store the nodes, and a two-dimensional array to store the edges.</description>
