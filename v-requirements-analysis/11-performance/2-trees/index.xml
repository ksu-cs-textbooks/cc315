    <title>Trees :: CC 315 Textbook</title>

    <description>There are three types of trees to consider: generic trees, tries, and binary trees.&#xA;General Trees Insert: In general, inserting an element into a tree by making it a child of an existing tree is a constant time operation. However, this depends on us already having access to the parent tree weâ€™d like to add the item to, which may require searching for that element in the tree as discussed below, which runs in linear time based on the size of the tree.</description>
