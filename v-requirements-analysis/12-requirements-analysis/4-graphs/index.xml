    <description>Graphs are a good data structure for relational data. This would include data in which elements can have some sort of similarity or distance defined between those elements. This measure of similarity between elements can be defined as realistically or abstractly as needed for the data set. The distance can be as simple as listing neighbors or adjacent elements.&#xA;Graphs Graphs are multidimensional data structures that can represent many different types of data using nodes and edges.</description>
