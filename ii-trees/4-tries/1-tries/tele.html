<p>Recall that in the beginning of our discussions about trees, we looked at a small tree which contained seven strings as motivation for trees. This was a small example of a trie (pronounced &rsquo;try&rsquo;) which is a type of tree that can represent sets of words.
<a href="#R-image-c30f84a4a67ad7809759f0b23120b958" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Trie Small Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc315/images/2/2Tree_SmallWords.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-c30f84a4a67ad7809759f0b23120b958"><img alt="Trie Small Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc315/images/2/2Tree_SmallWords.png"></a></p>
<p>Tries can be used for a variety of tasks ranging from leisurely games to accessibility applications. One example is &lsquo;Boggle&rsquo; where players have a set of random letters and try to make as many words as possible. To code this game, we could create a vocabulary with a trie then traverse it to determine if players have played legal words. We can also use tries to provide better typing accessibility. Users could type a few letters of a word and our code could traverse the trie and suggest what letters or words they may be trying to enter.</p>
<p>A trie is a type of tree with some special characteristics. First it must follow the guidelines of being a tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>There must be a single root,</li>
<li>Each child node has a single parent node,</li>
<li>It must be fully connected (no disjoint parts), and</li>
<li>There can be no cycles (no loops).</li>
</ul>
<p>The special characteristics for tries are:</p>
<ul>
<li>By starting at the root and traversing parent to children relationships we can build user-defined words, and</li>
<li>Each node has a boolean property to indicate if it is the end of a word.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, we will display nodes with two circles as a convention to show which nodes are the end of words. Looking at this small trie as an example, we can determine which words are contained in our trie.
<a href="#R-image-69276bcf8f3583c542ce9586e2294976" class="lightbox-link"><img alt="Trie Small Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc315/images/2/2Tree_SmallWords.png" style=" height: auto; width: auto;"></a>
<a href="javascript:history.back();" class="lightbox-back" id="R-image-69276bcf8f3583c542ce9586e2294976"><img alt="Trie Small Example" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow lightbox-image" loading="lazy" src="/cc315/images/2/2Tree_SmallWords.png"></a>
We start at the root, which will typically be an empty string, and traverse to a double lined node. <code>&quot;&quot; -&gt; a -&gt; l -&gt; l</code>. Thus, the word &lsquo;all&rsquo; is contained in our trie. Words within our tries do not have to end at leaves. For example, we can traverse <code>&quot;&quot; -&gt; a</code> for the word &lsquo;a&rsquo;. We say this trie &lsquo;contains&rsquo; seven words: &lsquo;a&rsquo;, &lsquo;an&rsquo;, &lsquo;and&rsquo;, &lsquo;ant&rsquo;, &lsquo;any&rsquo;, &lsquo;all&rsquo;, and &lsquo;alp&rsquo;.</p>
