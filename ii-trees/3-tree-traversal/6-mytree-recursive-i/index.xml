    <title>MyTree Recursive I :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/ii-trees/3-tree-traversal/6-mytree-recursive-i/</link>
    <description>Again, we want to be able to implement a working version of a tree. From the last module, we had functions to add children, remove children, get attributes, and instantiate MyTree. We will now build upon that implementation to create a true tree.&#xA;Info A recursive program is broken into two parts:&#xA;A base case—a simple version of the problem that can be solved directly, and A recursive case—a general solution to the problem that uses smaller versions of the problem to compute the solution to the larger problem.</description>
