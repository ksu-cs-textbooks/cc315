    <description>When working with multidimensional data structures, we also need to consider how they would be stored in a linear manner. Remember, pieces of data in computers are linear sequences of binary digits. As a result, we need a standard way of storing trees as a linear structure.&#xA;Path - a path is a sequence of nodes and edges, which connect a node with its descendant. We can look at some paths in the tree above:</description>
