    <title>Summary :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/ii-trees/3-tree-traversal/9-summary/</link>
    <description>In this section, we discussed more terminology related to trees as well as tree traversals. To recap the new vocabulary:&#xA;Ancestor - The ancestors of a node are those reached from child to parent relationships. We can think of this as our parents and the parents of our parents, and so on. Depth - The depth of a node is its distance to the root. Thus, the root has depth zero.</description>
