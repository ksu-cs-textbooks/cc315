    <description>While this is a valid binary tree, it is not balanced. Letâ€™s look at the following tree.&#xA;We have the same nodes but our root is now 12 whereas before it was 14. This is a valid binary tree. We call this a balanced binary tree. A balanced binary tree looks visually even amongst the left and right trees in terms of number of nodes.&#xA;Note: Balancing is not necessary for a valid binary tree.</description>
