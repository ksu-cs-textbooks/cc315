    <title>Traversals :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/ii-trees/5-binary-trees/3-traversals/</link>
    <description>In the first module we discussed two types of traversals: preorder and postorder. Within that discussion, we noted that for general trees, the preorder and postorder traversal may not be unique. This was due to the fact that children nodes are an unordered set.&#xA;Info We are now working with binary trees which have a defined child order. As a result, the preorder and postorder traversals will be unique! These means that for a binary tree when we do a preorder traversal there is exactly one string that is possible.</description>
