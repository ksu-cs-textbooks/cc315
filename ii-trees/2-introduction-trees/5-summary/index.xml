    <description>In this module we have introduce vocabulary related to trees and what makes a tree a tree. To recap, we have introduced the following:&#xA;Child - a node with an edge that connects to another node closer to the root. Degree Degree of a node - the number of children a node has. The degree of a leaf is zero. Degree of a tree - the number of children the root of the tree has.</description>
