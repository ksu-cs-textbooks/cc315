    <description>Resources Slides Video Script [Slide 1]&#xA;Our next data structure will be trees! Trees are a hierarchical structure and, as the name implies, trees are used to show hierarchies. These can include biologic classifications, like this dinosaur classification, work hierarchies, family trees, sports brackets and much more.&#xA;[Slide 2]&#xA;By comparison, strings and stacks are linear data structures. They contain data which has a defined linear order. In strings, we have exactly one character after another.</description>
