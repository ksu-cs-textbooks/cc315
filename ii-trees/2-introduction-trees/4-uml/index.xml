    <title>MyTree I :: CC 315 Textbook</title>

    <description>Video Materials&#xA;Along with understanding how trees work, we want to also be able to implement a tree of our own. We will now outline key components of a tree class.&#xA;MyTree Recall that trees are defined recursively so we can build them from the leaves up where each leaf is a tree itself. Each tree will have three properties: the item it contains as an object, its parent node of type MyTree, and its children as a list of MyTrees.</description>
