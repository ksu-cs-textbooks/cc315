<p>[Slide 1]</p>
<p>To be able to build trees, we must be able to add children. Again, trees are defined recursively so we are really adding trees to trees. Let&rsquo;s look at this example.</p>
<p>Here we have two trees and supposed we wanted to connect them by making node <code>x</code> a child of node <code>c</code>. Visually, we would simply add an edge from <code>c</code> to <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>[Slide 2]</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at these structures underlying code. We see that nodes <code>a</code> and <code>x</code> are both roots and <code>c</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code> are leaves. In principal, what we need to do is add the connection between <code>c</code> and <code>x</code>. To do this properly, there are two places that we need to update: the parent of <code>x</code> and the children of <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>[Slide 3]</p>
<p>Doing those updates would result in the following. We have added <code>c</code> as the parent of <code>x</code> and <code>x</code> as a child of <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>[Slide 4]</p>
<p>Now visually we have the connection from <code>c</code> to <code>x</code>. And thus, a single tree.</p>
<p>[Slide 5]</p>
<p>Adding a child is rather straightforward on the surface but there are a few considerations we must make. First, we must make sure that the child does not already have a parent. Then we also should check that the child is not already a child of the parent. This is a form of redundancy to make sure that we have checked both reference to the relationship.</p>
<p>[Slide 6]</p>
<p>Here we have the pseudocode for adding a child. The first two checks are for the considerations discussed in the last slide. If the child already has a parent, then we have an exception. If the child is already a child of the parent, then we return false. Then we update the parent&rsquo;s children and update the child&rsquo;s parent. After that, we return true so that the user can know it was successful.</p>
