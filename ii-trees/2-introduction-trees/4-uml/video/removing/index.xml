    <title>Removing Child :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/ii-trees/2-introduction-trees/4-uml/video/removing/</link>

Thinking of the example of a file tree, if we were to delete a file, that would remove it from our tree. In most cases, deleting a file just removes it from the current directory and into a trash or recycle folder. Meaning it is not removed from existence.</description>
