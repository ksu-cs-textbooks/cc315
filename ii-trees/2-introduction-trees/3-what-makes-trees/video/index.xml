    <description>Resources Slides Video Script [Slide 1]&#xA;Now that we have outlined key tree terms, we will cover some examples of trees and not trees.

[Slide 2]&#xA;In this figure, we have two key issues. Feel free to pause the video now if you would like determine them for yourself.</description>
