    <title>Introduction :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/i-strings/1-strings-and-stringbuilders/01-introduction/</link>
    <description>Video Materials&#xA;In CC310 we covered various data structures: stacks, sets, lists, queues, and hash tables. When we looked at these structures, we considered how to access elements within the structures, how we would create our own implementation of the structure, and tasks that these structures would be fitting for as well as ill fitting. Throughout this course we will introduce and implement a variety of data structures as we did in CC310.</description>
