    <title>Strings Introduction :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/i-strings/1-strings-and-stringbuilders/01-introduction/video/</link>
    <description>Resources Slides Video Script [Slide 1]&#xA;Throughout this course we will look at many types of data structures.&#xA;[Slide 2]&#xA;We have already seen a handful of structures in CC 310. In that course, we looked at the structures, how they worked such as accessing elements and determining sizes. We also looked at how we would implement our own versions of those structures. This course will follow a similar pattern as we work through new data structures.</description>
