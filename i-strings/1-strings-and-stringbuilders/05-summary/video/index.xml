    <description>Resources Slides Video Script [Slide 1]&#xA;We have discussed strings in a very theoretic way up to this point. Now we hope to shed light on strings in practice.&#xA;[Slide 2]&#xA;Throughout this module, we have discussed why we would want to use strings as a data structure, how they are used behind the scenes, and how we can improve upon that performance. For Java, we looked at StringBuilders and for Python, we looked at Arrays.</description>
