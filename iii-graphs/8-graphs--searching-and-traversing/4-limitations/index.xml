    <title>Limitations :: CC 315 Textbook</title>

    <description>When introducing graphs, we discussed how the components of a graph didnâ€™t have to all be connected. If our goal is to visit each node, like in the searches, then we will need to perform the search from every node.&#xA;For example, the graph below has two separate components. Lets walk through which nodes we will discover by calling the traversals from each node.&#xA;Start Visited (in alphabetical order) A {A, D, H} B {B, E, H, I} C {C} D {D} E {E, H, I} F {C, F} G {C, G} H {H} I {I} J {C, F, G, J} In this example, we would need to call either traversal on nodes A, B and J in order to visit all of the nodes.</description>
