    <title>Traveling Salesperson :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/iii-graphs/9-graphs--minimum-spanning-trees/5-traveling-salesperson/</link>
    <description>While we wonâ€™t outline algorithms suited for solving the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), we will outline the premise of the problem. This problem was first posed in 1832, almost a two centuries ago, and is still quite prevalent. It is applicable to traveling routes, distribution networks, computer architecture and much more. The TSP is a seminal problem that has motivated many research breakthroughs, including Kruskals algorithm!&#xA;The motivation of the TSP is this: given a set of locations, what is the shortest path such that we can visit each location and end back where started?</description>
