    <title>Minimum Spanning Trees :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/iii-graphs/9-graphs--minimum-spanning-trees/2-minimum-spanning-trees/</link>
    <description>Now that we have an understanding of general spanning trees, we will introduce the concept of minimum spanning trees. First let’s introduce the concept of the cost of a tree.&#xA;The cost that is associated with a tree, is the sum of its edges weights. Let’s look at this spanning tree which is from the previous page. The cost associated with this spanning tree is: 2+6+10+14=32. Minimum Spanning Trees (MST) A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree that has the smallest cost.</description>
