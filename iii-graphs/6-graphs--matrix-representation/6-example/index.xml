    <description>In the following graph, we have an example of a weighted and directed map. This map represents a zoo train where each node represents a station and each edge is a part of the track. Zoo guests can get on and off wherever they desire.&#xA;This graph is weighted as guests must pay the associated fee for each part of the track. Our example train also has a one way direction in most cases.</description>
