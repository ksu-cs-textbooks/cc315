    <title>Matrix Representation :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/iii-graphs/6-graphs--matrix-representation/7-matrix-representation/</link>
    <description>The first way that we can represent graphs is as matrices. In a matrix representation of a graph, we will have an array with all the nodes and a matrix to depict the edges. The matrix that depicts the edges is called the adjacency matrix.&#xA;To build the adjacency matrix, we go through the nodes and edges. If there is an edge with weight w going from i to j, then we put w in the (i,j) spot in our adjacency matrix.</description>
