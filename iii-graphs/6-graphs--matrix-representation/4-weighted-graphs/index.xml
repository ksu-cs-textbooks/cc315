    <title>Weighted Graphs :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/iii-graphs/6-graphs--matrix-representation/4-weighted-graphs/</link>
    <description>A weighted graph is a graph which has weights associated with the edges. These weights quantify the relationships, so they can represent dollars, minutes, miles, and many other factors which our data may depend upon.&#xA;Weights are not limited to physical quantities; they can also be our own defined similarity in text, product types, and anything for which we can create a similarity measure for. Letâ€™s look at concrete weights using the Amtrak example.</description>
