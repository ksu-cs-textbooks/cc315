    <description>add node: will add a node to the graph with the given value if our graph still has room. Procedurally, we will try to put the node in the first empty place we find. To do this, we start with IDX equal to negative one then loop through all of the indexes of the graphs nodes attribute. At each index, we check if that entry is equal to the value we are trying to add.</description>
