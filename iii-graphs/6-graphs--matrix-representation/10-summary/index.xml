    <title>Summary :: CC 315 Textbook</title>
    <link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cc315/iii-graphs/6-graphs--matrix-representation/10-summary/</link>
    <description>In this module, we have introduced the graph data structure. We also looked at how we would implement a graph using a matrix representation. We introduced the following new concepts in this module:&#xA;Directed Graphs: A directed graph is a graph that has a direction associated with each edge. The flat end of the arrow will represent the origin and the arrowhead will represent the destination. If an edge has no arrowheads, then it is assumed that we can traverse both directions.</description>
