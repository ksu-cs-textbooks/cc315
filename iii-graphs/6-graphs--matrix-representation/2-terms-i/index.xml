    <description>We will discuss some of the basic terminology associated with graphs. Some of this vocabulary should feel familiar from the trees section; trees are a specific type of graph!&#xA;Nodes: Node is the general term for a structure which contains an item. Size: The size of a graph is the number of nodes. Capacity: The capacity of a graph is the maximum number of nodes. Info Nodes can be, but are not limited to the following examples: - physical locations (IE Manhattan, Topeka, Salina), - computer components (IE CPU, GPU, RAM), or - people (IE Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Emma Stone)</description>
