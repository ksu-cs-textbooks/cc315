      <description>The next data structure we will introduce is a graph.&#xA;Graphs are multidimensional data structures that can represent many different types of data. We can use graphs to represent electronic circuits and wiring, transportation routes, and networks such as the Internet or social groups.&#xA;A popular and fun use of graphs is to build connections between people such as Facebook friends or even connections between performers. One example is the parlor game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.</description>

      <description>We will discuss some of the basic terminology associated with graphs. Some of this vocabulary should feel familiar from the trees section; trees are a specific type of graph!&#xA;Nodes: Node is the general term for a structure which contains an item. Size: The size of a graph is the number of nodes. Capacity: The capacity of a graph is the maximum number of nodes. Info Nodes can be, but are not limited to the following examples: - physical locations (IE Manhattan, Topeka, Salina), - computer components (IE CPU, GPU, RAM), or - people (IE Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Emma Stone)</description>

      <description>While trees are a type of graph, graphs can have more functionality than trees. For example, recall that to be a single tree, there could be no disconnected pieces.&#xA;Connectedness: Graphs do not require being fully connected. There can be disconnected portions within a graph. For example, the following graph shows all of the students in a sophomore biology class. There is an edge between two student nodes if they are Facebook friends.</description>

      <description>A weighted graph is a graph which has weights associated with the edges. These weights quantify the relationships, so they can represent dollars, minutes, miles, and many other factors which our data may depend upon.&#xA;Weights are not limited to physical quantities; they can also be our own defined similarity in text, product types, and anything for which we can create a similarity measure for. Letâ€™s look at concrete weights using the Amtrak example.</description>

      <description>A directed graph is a graph that has a direction associated with each edge. For example, trees are a directed graph. The edge orientation will imply a fixed direction that we can move about nodes. As with trees, the flat end of the arrow will represent the origin and the arrowhead will represent the destination. If an edge has no arrowheads, then it is assumed that we can traverse both directions.</description>

      <description>In the following graph, we have an example of a weighted and directed map. This map represents a zoo train where each node represents a station and each edge is a part of the track. Zoo guests can get on and off wherever they desire.&#xA;This graph is weighted as guests must pay the associated fee for each part of the track. Our example train also has a one way direction in most cases.</description>

      <description>The first way that we can represent graphs is as matrices. In a matrix representation of a graph, we will have an array with all the nodes and a matrix to depict the edges. The matrix that depicts the edges is called the adjacency matrix.&#xA;To build the adjacency matrix, we go through the nodes and edges. If there is an edge with weight w going from i to j, then we put w in the (i,j) spot in our adjacency matrix.</description>

      <description>Attributes nodes: This will keep track of the nodes which are in our graph as well as the node values. The nodes can have any type of value such as numbers, characters, and even other data structures. edges: This will keep track of the edges which are in our graph. size: This will keep track of the number of nodes that are active in our graph. Upon initialization, we will initialize nodes to be an empty array of size capacity, edges to be an empty two-dimensional array with dimensions capacity by capacity and size to be zero as we start with no actual nodes.</description>

      <description>add node: will add a node to the graph with the given value if our graph still has room. Procedurally, we will try to put the node in the first empty place we find. To do this, we start with IDX equal to negative one then loop through all of the indexes of the graphs nodes attribute. At each index, we check if that entry is equal to the value we are trying to add.</description>

      <description>In this module, we have introduced the graph data structure. We also looked at how we would implement a graph using a matrix representation. We introduced the following new concepts in this module:&#xA;Directed Graphs: A directed graph is a graph that has a direction associated with each edge. The flat end of the arrow will represent the origin and the arrowhead will represent the destination. If an edge has no arrowheads, then it is assumed that we can traverse both directions.</description>
