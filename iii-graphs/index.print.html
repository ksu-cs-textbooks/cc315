<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVIlBepiPEc">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>The next data structure we will introduce is a graph.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/graphex1.svg" alt="Graph Example 1"></p>
<p>Graphs are multidimensional data structures that can represent many different types of data. We can use graphs to represent electronic circuits and wiring, transportation routes, and networks such as the Internet or social groups.</p>
<p>A popular and fun use of graphs is to build connections between people such as Facebook friends or even connections between performers. One example is the parlor game 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>. Players attempt to connect Kevin Bacon to other performers through movie roles in six people or less.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/actors.svg" alt="Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon"></p>
<p>For example, Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Bacon are directly connected via &lsquo;Mystic River&rsquo;. Keanu Reeves and Kevin Bacon have never performed in the same film, but Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are connected via &lsquo;The Matrix&rsquo;. Thus, Keanu and Kevin are connected via Laurence.</p>
<p>In this module we will discuss graphs in more detail and build our own implementation of graphs.</p>

<h1>Terms I</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIX78W3GUpc">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>We will discuss some of the basic terminology associated with graphs. Some of this vocabulary should feel familiar from the trees section; trees are a specific type of graph!</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Nodes</code>: Node is the general term for a structure which contains an item.
<ul>
<li><code>Size</code>: The size of a graph is the number of nodes.</li>
<li><code>Capacity</code>: The capacity of a graph is the maximum number of nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p><strong>Nodes</strong> can be, but are not limited to the following examples:
- physical locations (IE Manhattan, Topeka, Salina),
- computer components (IE CPU, GPU, RAM), or 
- people (IE Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Emma Stone)</p>
    </div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><code>Edges</code>: Edges are the connection between two nodes. Depending on the data, edges can represent physical distance, films, cost, and much more.
<ul>
<li><code>Adjacent</code>: Node A and node B are said to be adjacent if there is an edge from node A to node B.</li>
<li><code>Neighbors</code>: The neighbors of a node are nodes which are adjacent to the node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p><strong>Edges</strong> can be, but are not limited to:
- physical distances, like the distance between cities or wiring between computer components,
- cost, like bus fares, and 
- films, like the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon example</p>
    </div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><code>Cycles</code>: A cycle is a path where the first and last node are the only repeated nodes. More explicitly, this means that we start at node A and are able to end up back at node A.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>For example, we can translate the 

<a href="https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/Maps/Amtrak-System-Map-1018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amtrak Train Station Connections</a> into a graph where the edges represent direct train station connections.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/amtrak.svg" alt="Amtrak Train Graph">^[Generated using the Amtrak system map from 2018. This graph does not include all stations or connections.]</p>
<p>Within this context, we could say that Little Rock and Fort Worth are <code>adjacent</code>. The <code>neighbors</code> of San Antonio are Fort Worth, Los Angeles, and New Orleans. The Amtrak Train Graph has multiple <code>cycles</code>. One of these is <code>Kansas City -&gt; St. Louis -&gt; Chicago -&gt; Kansas City</code>.</p>

<h1>Graph Features</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_mNd-CIFpc">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>While trees are a type of graph, graphs can have more functionality than trees. For example, recall that to be a single tree, there could be no disconnected pieces.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Connectedness</code>: Graphs do not require being fully connected. There can be disconnected portions within a graph. For example, the following graph shows all of the students in a sophomore biology class. There is an edge between two student nodes if they are Facebook friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../images/6/friends.svg" alt="Friends Group"></p>
<p>Graphs can also have loops. In a tree, this would be like a node being its own parent, which is not an allowable condition.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Loops</code>: Loops are edges which connect a node to itself. These can be useful in depicting graphs that show control flow in programming. In this example, node A is connected to node B and node A is connected to itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../images/6/loop2.svg" alt="With a Loop"></p>

<h1>Weighted Graphs</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4_myCOtFnk">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>A <strong>weighted</strong> graph is a graph which has weights associated with the edges. These weights quantify the relationships, so they can represent dollars, minutes, miles, and many other factors which our data may depend upon.</p>
<p>Weights are not limited to physical quantities; they can also be our own defined similarity in text, product types, and anything for which we can create a similarity measure for. Let&rsquo;s look at concrete weights using the Amtrak example.</p>
<p>We are able to expand the Amtrak graph from the previous page to include approximate distances in miles between cities.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/amtrak_dist.svg" alt="Amtrak Train Graph with Weights">^[Generated using the Amtrak system map from 2018. This graph does not include all stations or connections. Distance was calculated approximately &lsquo;as the crow flies&rsquo;.]</p>
<p>Now that we have weights defined on our edges, we can compare paths in a different way. When we discussed trees, we just looked at the number of edges it took to get to another node. We can also determine the shortest path between nodes with respect to distance. If we wanted to travel from San Antonio to Kansas City, we may be tempted to travel <code>San Antoinio -&gt; Los Angeles -&gt; Albuquerque -&gt; Kansas City</code> as it has the fewest stops. This trip would take us 2,531 miles (1201+640+690). With the edge weights in mind, a much better route would be <code>San Antonio -&gt; Fort Worth -&gt; Little Rock -&gt; St. Louis -&gt; Kansas City</code> with a total of 1,089 miles(238+320+293+238) traveled.</p>

<h1>Directed Graphs</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7qyV9XOwzA">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>A <strong>directed</strong> graph is a graph that has a direction associated with each edge. For example, trees are a directed graph. The edge orientation will imply a fixed direction that we can move about nodes. As with trees, the flat end of the arrow will represent the origin and the arrowhead will represent the destination. If an edge has no arrowheads, then it is assumed that we can traverse both directions.</p>
<p>In the following graph, we have an example distribution network where each store ends up with 5 units in its possession. For example, nine units go from the distribution center to Store A. The distribution center will never receive product from stores as it has no incoming edges.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/distribution-3.svg" alt="Sample Distribution Network"></p>
<p>Unlike trees, directed graphs can have nodes with multiple incoming edges. We can see an example of this at Store B. The distribution center and Store A both send units to Store B.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>In directed graphs, we must be cautious on how we define <strong>adjacent</strong>. For the following, we would say that the source is adjacent to the target. However, the target is not adjacent to the source.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/src_tar_ex.svg" alt="Source and Target Example"></p>
<p>Formally, node A and node B are said to be adjacent if there is an edge from node A to node B.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>When discussing directed graphs, we must also talk about undirected graphs. An <strong>undirected</strong> graph is a graph in which none of the edges have an orientation. If there is at least one directed edge, then it is considered a directed graph.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Undirected Edge</code>: An undirected edge is an edge which has no defined orientation (IE no arrowheads) which implies that we can traverse in either direction. If node A and node B are connected via an undirected edge then we say node A is adjacent to node B and node B is adjacent to node A.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Example</h1>
<p>In the following graph, we have an example of a weighted and directed map. This map represents a zoo train where each node represents a station and each edge is a part of the track. Zoo guests can get on and off wherever they desire.</p>
<p>This graph is weighted as guests must pay the associated fee for each part of the track. Our example train also has a one way direction in most cases. The exception to this is the entrance/exit to the aquarium, this part of the track can go either direction.</p>
<p>In this graph, we also have a couple of loops. This would allow for zoo-guests to ride the train around an expansive exhibit such as the elephants or giraffes.</p>
<p>One possible way to tour the zoo for a guest starting at the entrance could be: aquarium, primates, big cats, antelope, giraffes, loop around the giraffes, elephants, aquarium, then exit. Their total payment for just the train would be $14.</p>

<h1>Matrix Representation</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwd8YkQwoqM">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>The first way that we can represent graphs is as matrices. In a matrix representation of a graph, we will have an array with all the nodes and a matrix to depict the edges. The matrix that depicts the edges is called the <code>adjacency matrix</code>.</p>
<p>To build the <code>adjacency matrix</code>, we go through the nodes and edges. If there is an edge with weight <code>w</code> going from <code>i</code> to <code>j</code>, then we put <code>w</code> in the <code>(i,j)</code> spot in our <code>adjacency matrix</code>. If there is no edge from <code>i</code> to <code>j</code> then we put infinity in the spot <code>(i,j)</code>. Let&rsquo;s look at some examples.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>An edge that starts at <code>source</code> and ends at <code>target</code> will result in an entry at <code>(source,target)</code> in the adjacency matrix.</p>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>For an unweighted graph, we treat the weights as 1 for all edges in our adjacency matrix.</p>
<p>For an undirected edge between nodes <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, we put an edge from <code>i</code> to <code>j</code> and an edge from <code>j</code> to <code>i</code>.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<h2 id="example-1">Example 1</h2>
<p>Suppose that we have the following graph:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/graphA.svg" alt="Matrix Representation Example"></p>
<p>Across the top of the following, we have the array of nodes. This give us the index at which each node is located. For example, node A is in spot <code>1</code>, node B is in spot <code>2</code>, node C is in spot <code>3</code> and so on.</p>
<p>Below that we have the adjacency matrix. For the directed edge with weight 2 that goes from node B to node C, we have the value 2 at (2,3) in the adjacency matrix as B has index 2 and C has index 3. For the directed edge with weight 4 that goes from node A to node F, we have the value 4 at (1,6) in the adjacency matrix as A has index 1 and F has index 6.</p>
<p>Since there is no edge that connects from node A to node B, we have infinity in <code>(1,2)</code>.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/matrixA.svg" alt="Matrix"></p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example 2</h2>
<p>Now suppose we have this graph. We now have some loops present. 
<img src="../../images/6/graphB.svg" alt="Matrix Representation Example 2"></p>
<p>For example, we have a loop on node E with weight 12 so we will put the value 12 in spot (5,5) as E has index 5.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/matrixB.svg" alt="Matrix 2"></p>
<h2 id="example-3">Example 3</h2>
<p>Now suppose we have this graph which is undirected and unweighted. 
<img src="../../images/6/graphC.svg" alt="Matrix Representation Example 3"></p>
<p>Since this graph is unweighted, we will treat all edges as though they have weight equal to one. Since this graph is undirected, each edge will essentially show up twice.</p>
<p>For example, for the edge that connects nodes A and B, we will have an entry in our adjacency matrix at <code>(1,2)</code> and <code>(2,1)</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>add node</code>: will add a node to the graph with the given value if our graph still has room. Procedurally, we will try to put the node in the first empty place we find. To do this, we start with <code>IDX</code> equal to negative one then loop through all of the indexes of the graphs <code>nodes</code> attribute. At each index, we check if that entry is equal to the value we are trying to add. This will check if the value is already in our graph. If there is nothing in that entry and the <code>IDX</code> variable is still negative one, then we will set <code>IDX</code> equal to that index. We continue looping through the <code>nodes</code> attribute until we reach the end. It is possible that there is more than one open space in the <code>nodes</code> attribute. Thus, by checking if <code>IDX</code> is still negative one we can make sure to put <code>value</code> in the first empty spot. Once we finish going through <code>nodes</code> we check to see if we ever found an open spot. If <code>IDX</code> is still negative one, this would indicate that there was no room.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In this module, we have introduced the graph data structure. We also looked at how we would implement a graph using a matrix representation. We introduced the following new concepts in this module:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Directed Graphs</code>: A directed graph is a graph that has a direction associated with each edge. The flat end of the arrow will represent the origin and the arrowhead will represent the destination. If an edge has no arrowheads, then it is assumed that we can traverse both directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Edges</code>: Edges are the connection between two nodes. Depending on the data, edges can represent physical distance, films, cost, and much more.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Adjacent</code>: Node A and node B are said to be adjacent if there is an edge from node A to node B.</li>
<li><code>Neighbors</code>: The neighbors of a node are nodes which are adjacent to the node.</li>
<li><code>Undirected Edge</code>: An undirected edge is an edge which has no defined orientation (IE no arrowheads). If node A and node B are connected via an undirected edge then we say node A is adjacent to node B and node B is adjacent to node A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Loops</code>: Loops are edges which connect a node to itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Nodes</code>: Node is the general term for a structure which contains an item.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Size</code>: The size of a graph is the number of nodes.</li>
<li><code>Capacity</code>: The capacity of a graph is the maximum number of nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Weighted Graphs</code>: A weighted graph is a graph which has weights associated with the edges. These weights will quantify the  relationships so they can represent dollars, minutes, miles, and many other factors which our data may depend on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next module, we will look at a list implementation of graphs and when we might use one implementation over the other.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgN_qmbtK_M">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>In the previous module, we introduced graphs and a matrix-based implementation. For this module, we will continue working with graphs and change our implementation to lists.</p>
<h2 id="why-another-implementation">Why Another Implementation?</h2>
<p>When using graphs, a lot of situational variation can occur. Some graphs can have a few nodes with many edges, many nodes with few edges, and so on. When we use the matrix implementation, we initialize a matrix with the number of columns and rows equal to the number of nodes. For example, if we have a graph with 20 nodes, our adjacency matrix would have 20 rows and 20 columns, resulting in 400 potential entries.</p>
<p>First let&rsquo;s look at the implementation and then we will discuss when one may be better than the other.</p>

<h1>List Representation</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJqStsuqf_U">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>In the matrix representation, we had an array of the node items. In the list representation, we will have an array of node objects. Each <strong>node object</strong> will keep track of the node item, the node index, and the outgoing edges.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/7/list_graph_setup.svg" alt="Set Up"></p>
<p>The <code>item</code> can be any object and the <code>index</code> will be a value within our capacity. The <code>edges</code> will be a list of pairs where the first entry is the index of the target node and the second entry is the weight of the edge.</p>
<p>Since each node will track its neighbors, it is important that we are consistent in our indexing of nodes. If our nodes were to get out of order, then our edges would as well.</p>
<h2 id="example-1">Example 1</h2>
<p>Consider the following graph which we saw in the matrix representation.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/graphA.svg" alt="Example 1"></p>
<p>The following list of nodes depicts the graph above. We can see that each node object has the item and index.</p>
<p>If we look closer at the <code>edges</code> of the node with item <code>A</code> and index <code>1</code>, we see that the set of edges is equal to <code>[(4, 3.0), (6, 4.0)]</code>. This corresponds to the fact that there are two edges with the source as node <code>1</code>. The first ordered pair, <code>(4, 3.0)</code>, means that there is an edge with source node <code>1</code> (<code>A</code>) and target node <code>4</code> (<code>D</code>) that has weight <code>3</code>. We can confirm that in our graph we do have an edge from <code>A</code> to <code>D</code> with weight <code>3</code>.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/7/graphA_list_rep.svg" alt="List Representation for Example 1"></p>
<h2 id="example-2">Example 2</h2>
<p>The following includes a couple of examples of loops within our graph.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/6/graphB.svg" alt="Example 2"></p>
<p>We have loops on nodes <code>D</code>, <code>E</code>, and <code>F</code> in our graph. Recall that a loop is an edge where the source and target are the same. For example, we have an edge with source <code>D</code> and target <code>D</code> that has weight <code>12</code>. We see this in our list representation in the node object with item <code>D</code> and index <code>4</code>, where we have the entry <code>(4,12.0)</code> in the edges.</p>

<h1>Dense VS Sparse</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4bCalShe_Y">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>When considering which implementation to use, we need to consider the connectivity in our graph. The terms that we use to describe the connectedness are <strong>dense</strong> and <strong>sparse</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Dense Graph</code>: A dense graph is a graph in which there is a large number of edges. Typically in a dense graph, the number of edges is close to the maximum number of edges.</li>
<li><code>Sparse Graph</code>: A sparse graph is a graph in which there is a small number of edges. In this case the number of edges is considerably less than the maximum number of edges.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="box-content">
<p>Intuitively, we can think of dense and sparse in terms of populations. For example, if 100 people lived in a city block, we can consider that to be densely populated. If 100 people lived in 100 square miles we can consider that to be sparsely populated.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some motivating examples to get an idea of how the different structures will handle these cases.</p>

<p>The following is a dense graph. In this case, our graph does have the maximum number of edges. This means that every node is connected to every other node including itself.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/7/dense_graph.svg" alt="Dense Graph">
<img src="../../images/7/dense_matrix.svg" alt="Dense Graph as Matrix">
<img src="../../images/7/dense_list.svg" alt="Dense Graph as List"></p>
<h2 id="sparse">Sparse</h2>
<p>The following is a sparse graph.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/7/sparse_graph.svg" alt="Sparse Graph">
<img src="../../images/7/sparse_matrix.svg" alt="Sparse Graph as Matrix">
<img src="../../images/7/sparse_list.svg" alt="Sparse Graph as List"></p>
<h2 id="list-or-matrix">List or Matrix?</h2>
<p>For dense graphs, the matrix representation will have better qualities as we are already setting aside space for the maximum number of edges. Sparse graphs are better represented in the list representation.</p>
<p>When we initialize the matrix implementation, we initialize the <code>nodes</code> attribute to have dimension equal to the capacity of the graph. The <code>edges</code> attribute is initialized to be a square matrix with dimension equal to capacity by capacity. Thus, if we have a sparse matrix, we are representing a lot of non-existent edges.</p>
<p>When we initialize the list implementation, we just have the <code>nodes</code> attribute which has dimension equal to the capacity and each node tracks its own edges. If we have a dense matrix and we are searching for an edge, we must loop through each edge from the target node to see if the edge exists. In the matrix representation, we can access that edge directly.</p>

<p>If the proportion of edges to the maximum number of edges is greater than 1/64, then the matrix representation is better in terms of space.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p><img src="../../images/6/graphA.svg" alt="Example 1"></p>
<p>In this module, we introduced a new way to store the graph data structure. Thus, we now have two ways to work with graphs, in lists and in matrices:</p>
<h2 id="list-representation">List Representation</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/7/graphA_list_rep.svg" alt="List Representation for Example 1"></p>
<h2 id="matrix-representation">Matrix Representation</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/6/matrixA.svg" alt="Matrix Representation for Example 1"></p>
<p>While these methods show the same information, there are cases when one way may be more desirable than the other.</p>
<p>We discussed how a sparse graph is better suited for a list representation and a dense graph is better suited for a matrix representation. We also touched on how working with the edges in a list representation can add complexity to our edge functions. If we are needing to access edge weights or update edges frequently, a matrix representation would be a good choice &ndash; especially if we have a lot of nodes.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGiEVQE1hR4">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>In the previous modules, we have introduced graphs and two implementations. This module will cover the traversals through graphs as well as path search techniques.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>As we have discussed previously, graphs can have many applications. Based on that, there are many things that we may want to infer from graphs. For example, if we have a graph that depicts a railroad or electrical network, we could determine what maximum flow of the network. The standard approach for this task is the 

<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ford-fulkerson-algorithm-for-maximum-flow-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm</a>. In short, given a graph with edge weights that represent capacities the algorithm will determine the maximum flow throughout the graph.</p>
<p>From the matrix graph module, we used the following distribution network as an example. 
<img src="../../images/6/distribution-3.svg" alt="Sample Distribution Network"></p>
<p>Conceptually, we would want to determine the maximum number of units that could leave the distribution center without having excess laying around stores. Using the maximum flow algorithm, we would determine that the maximum number of units would be 15.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/8/distribution-3MAX.svg" alt="Max Flow"></p>
<p>The driving force in the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, as well as other maximum  flow algorithms, is the ability to find a path from a source to a target. Specifically, these algorithms use breadth first and depth first searches to discover possible paths.</p>
<h2 id="searches">Searches</h2>
<p>To get to introducing the searches, we will first discuss the basis of them. Those are the depth first traversal and the breadth first traversal. We will outline the premise of these traversals and then discuss how we can modify their algorithms for various tasks, such as path searches.</p>
<p>We can perform these traversals on any type of graph. Conceptually, it will help to have a tree-like structure in mind to differentiate between depth first and breadth first.</p>

<p>First we will discuss Depth First Traversal. We can define the depth first traversal in two ways, iteratively or recursively. For this course, we will define it iteratively.</p>
<p>In the iterative algorithm, we will initialize an empty stack and an empty set. The stack will determine which node we search next and the set will track which nodes we have already searched.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Recall that a stack is a &lsquo;Last In First Out&rsquo; (LIFO) structure. Based on this, the depth first traversal will traverse a nodes descendants before its siblings.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>To do the traversal, we must pick a starting node; this can be an arbitrary node in our graph. If we were doing the traversal on a tree, we would typically select the root at a starting point. We start a while loop to go through the stack which we will be pushing and popping from. We get the top element of the stack, if the node has not been visited yet then we will add it to the set to note that we have now visited it. Then we get the neighbors of the node and put them onto the stack and continue the process until the stack is empty.</p>

<h1>Breadth First</h1>

<p>We can also perform a breadth first traversal either iteratively or recursively. As with the depth first traversal, we will define it iteratively.</p>
<p>In the iterative algorithm, we initialize an empty queue and an empty set. Like depth first traversal, the set will track which nodes we have discovered. We now use a queue to track which node we will search next.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>Recall that a queue is a &lsquo;First In First Out&rsquo; (FIFO) structure. Based on this, the breadth first traversal will traverse a nodes siblings before its descendants.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>Again, we must pick a starting node; this can be an arbitrary node in our graph. We add the starting node to our queue and the set of discovered nodes. We start a while loop to go through the queue which we will be enqueue  and dequeue from. We get the first element of the queue, then get the neighbors of the current node. We loop through each edge adding the neighbor to the discovered set and the queue if it has not already been discovered. We continue this process until the queue is empty.</p>

<p>It is important to remember in these implementations that a stack is used for depth first and a queue is used for a breadth first. The stack, being a LIFO structure, will proceed with the newest entry which will put us farther away from the source. The queue, being a FIFO structure, will proceed with oldest entry which will focus the algorithm more on the adjacent nodes. If we were to use say a queue for a depth first search, we would be traversing neighbors before descendants.</p>

<h1>Limitations</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSz7UDs0cH8">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>When introducing graphs, we discussed how the components of a graph didn&rsquo;t have to all be connected. If our goal is to visit each node, like in the searches, then we will need to perform the search from every node.</p>
<p>For example, the graph below has two separate components. Lets walk through which nodes we will discover by calling the traversals from each node.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/8/8search_dis.svg" alt="Disconnected Graph"></p>
<table>

<p>In this example, we would need to call either traversal on nodes A, B and J in order to visit all of the nodes.</p>

<h1>Finding a Path</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKy-q1hWPpQ">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>An important application for these traversals is the ability to find a path between two nodes. This has many applications in railroad networks as well as electrical wiring. With some modifications to the traversals, we can determine if electricity can flow from a source to a target. We will modify depth first and breadth first traversals in similar ways.</p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>There are three cases that can happen when we search for a path between nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Path: will return nothing</li>
<li>One Path: will return the path</li>
<li>Multiple Paths: will return A path</li>
</ul>
<p>With these searches, we are not guaranteed to return the same path if there are multiple paths.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<p>We will call these Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). In both traversals, we have added the following extra lines: 4, 9-16, and 22 through the end.</p>
<p>First, we have the addition of <code>PARENT_MAP</code> which will be a dictionary to keep track of how we get from one node to another. We will use the convention of having the key be the child and the value be the parent. While we use the terms child and parent, this is not exclusive to trees.</p>
<p>The ending portion starting at line 22, will add entries to our dictionary. If we haven&rsquo;t already found an edge to <code>NODE</code>, then we will add the edge that we are currently on.</p>
<p>The other addition is the block of code from line 9 to 16. We will enter this <code>if</code> block if the node that we are currently at is the target. This means that we have finally found a path from the source node to the target node. The process in this segment of code will backtrack through the path and build the path.</p>

<h1>In Practice</h1>
<h2 id="traveling">Traveling</h2>
<p>Finding a path in a graph is a very common application in many fields. One application that we benefit from in our day to day lives is traveling. Programs like Google Maps calculate various paths from point A to point B.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/8/Map.png" alt="Google Map">^[google.com/maps]</p>
<p>In the context of graph data structures, we can think of each intersection as a node and each road as an edge. Google Maps, however, tracks more features of edges than we have discussed. Not only do they track the distance between intersections, they also track time, tolls, construction, road surface and much more. In the next module, we will discuss more details of how we can find the shortest path.</p>
<h2 id="map-coloring">Map Coloring</h2>
<p>Another application of the general searches is coloring maps. The premise is that we don&rsquo;t want two adjacent territories to have the coloring. These territories could be states, like in the United States map below, counties, provinces, countries, and much more.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/8/USMap.png" alt="US Map">^[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_USA_showing_state_names.png]</p>
<p>The following was generated for this course using the breadth first search and <code>MyMatrixGraph</code> class that we have implemented in this course. To create the visual rendering, the Python library <code>NetworkX</code>^[https://networkx.github.io/] was used. In this rendering, the starting node was Utah. If we were to start from say Alabama or Florida, we would not have a valid four coloring scheme once we got to Nevada. Since Hawaii and Alaska have no land border with any of the states, they can be any color.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rtlwi7b_PF8">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>We will continue to work with graph algorithms in this module, specifically with finding minimum spanning trees (MST). MSTs have many real world applications such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical wiring,</li>
<li>Distribution networks,</li>
<li>Telecommunication networks, and</li>
<li>Network routing</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose we were building an apartment complex and wanted to determine the most cost-effective wiring schema. Below, we have the possible construction costs for wiring apartment to apartment. Wiring vertically adjacent apartments is cheaper than wiring horizontally adjacent units and those closest to the power closet have lower costs as well.
<img src="../../images/9/possibe_wiring.svg" alt="Possible Wiring"></p>
<p>To find the best possible solution, we would find the MST. The final wiring schema may look something like the figure below. 
<img src="../../images/9/mini_wire.svg" alt="Possible Wiring"></p>
<p>Determining a MST can result in lower costs and time used in many applications, especially logistics. 
To properly define a minimum spanning tree, we will first introduce the concept of a spanning tree.</p>
<h2 id="spanning-trees">Spanning Trees</h2>
<p>A <strong>spanning tree</strong> for a graph is a subset of the graphs edges such that each node is visited once, no cycles are present, and there are no disconnected components.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at this graph as an example. We have five nodes and seven edges.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/9/315_9_tree1.svg" alt="Graph"></p>
<p>Below, we have valid examples of spanning trees. In each of the examples, we visit each node and there are no cycles. Recall that a cycle is a path in which the starting node and ending node are the same.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/9/315_9_tree1STs.svg" alt="Spanning Trees"></p>

  
  
<div class="box notices cstyle info">
    <div class="box-label"><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div>
    <div class="box-content">
<p>To be a spanning tree of a graph, it must:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>span</strong> the graph, meaning all nodes must be visited, and</li>
<li>be a <strong>tree</strong>, meaning there are no cycles and no disconnected components.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, we can imagine selecting a node in a spanning tree as the root and letting gravity take effect. This gives us a visual motivation as to why they are called spanning trees. In these examples, we have selected node A for the root for each of the spanning trees above.</p>

<p>Below, we have invalid examples of spanning trees. In the left column, the examples are where all of the nodes are not connected in the same component. In the right column, the examples contain cycles. For example in the top right, we have the cycle <code>B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;E-&gt;B</code></p>

<h1>Minimum Spanning Trees</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMo3sTRoVrE">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>Now that we have an understanding of general spanning trees, we will introduce the concept of minimum spanning trees. First let&rsquo;s introduce the concept of the cost of a tree.</p>
<p>The <strong>cost</strong> that is associated with a tree, is the sum of its edges weights. Let&rsquo;s look at this spanning tree which is from the previous page. The cost associated with this spanning tree is: <code>2+6+10+14=32</code>.
<img src="../../images/9/315_9_cost.svg" alt="Graph"></p>
<h2 id="minimum-spanning-trees-mst">Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)</h2>
<p>A <strong>minimum spanning tree</strong> is a spanning tree that has the smallest cost. Recall the graph from the previous page.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/9/315_9_tree1.svg" alt="Graph"></p>
<p>Below on the left is a minimum spanning tree for the graph above. On the right is an example of a spanning tree, though it does not have the minimum cost.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/9/315_9_tree1MST.svg" alt="Minimum Spanning Tree"></p>
<p>In this small example, it is rather straightforward to find the minimum spanning tree. We can use a bit of trial and error to determine if we have the minimum spanning tree or not. However, once the graphs start to get more nodes and more edges it quickly becomes more complicated.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/9/315_9lrgTree.svg" alt="Graph"></p>
<p>There are two algorithms that we will introduce to give us a methodical way of finding the minimum spanning tree. The first that we will look at is Kruskal&rsquo;s algorithm and then we will look at Prim&rsquo;s algorithm.</p>

<h1>Kruskal</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av-r-orP56g">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>As graphs get larger, it is important to go about finding the MST in a methodical way. In the mid 1950&rsquo;s, there was a desire to form an algorithmic approach for solving the &rsquo;traveling salesperson&rsquo; problem^[We will describe this problem in a future section of this module]. Joseph Kruskal first published this algorithm in 1956 in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society^[https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1956-007-01/S0002-9939-1956-0078686-7/S0002-9939-1956-0078686-7.pdf]. The algorithms prior to this were, as Kruskal said, &ldquo;unnecessarily elaborate&rdquo; thus the need for a more succinct algorithm arose.</p>
<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>In his original work, Kruskal outlined three different yet similar algorithms to finding a minimum spanning tree. The <code>Kruskal Algorithm</code> that we use is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with only the nodes of the graph and an empty set for the edges</li>
<li>Order the edges based on weight</li>
<li>Make each node their own set</li>
<li>Go through the edges in ascending order</li>
<li>If nodes <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> are connected by the edge and they are not in the same set yet, then join the two sets and add the edge to your set of edges</li>
</ol>

<h1>Prim</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9bG6FTj5pA">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>The history of <code>Prim's Algorithm</code> is not as straight forward as Kruskal&rsquo;s. While we often call it <code>Prim's Algorithm</code>, it was originally developed in 1930 by Vojtěch Jarník. Robert Prim later rediscovered and republished this algorithm in 1957, one year after Kruskals. To add to the naming confusion, Edsger Dijkstra also published this work again in 1959. Because of this, the algorithm can go by many names: <code>Jarkík's Algorithm</code>, <code>Jarník-Prim's Algorithm</code>, <code>Prim-Dijkstra's Algorithm</code>, and <code>DJP Algorithm</code>.</p>
<p>Prim cited &ldquo;large-scale communication&rdquo; as the motivation for this algorithm, specifically the &ldquo;Bell System leased-line&rdquo;^[R.C. Prim, May 8, 1957 Shortest Connection Networks And Some Generalizations https://archive.org/details/bstj36-6-1389]. Leased lines were used primarily in a commercial setting which connected business offices that were geographically distant (IE in different cities or even states). Companies would want all offices to be connected but wanted to avoid having to lay an excessive amount of wire. Below is a figure which Prim used to motivate the need for the algorithm. This image depicts the minimum spanning tree which connect each of the US continental state capitals along with Washington D.C.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h2>
<p>The basis of the algorithm is to start with only the nodes of the graph, then we do the following</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a random node</li>
<li>Grow your tree by one edge, selecting the smallest edge to connect to a node that is not yet in the tree. Repeat until all the nodes have been visited</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Uniqueness</strong></p>
<p>You may have noticed that the minimum spanning tree that resulted from Kruskal&rsquo;s algorithm differed from Prim&rsquo;s algorithm. We have displaying them both below for reference.</p>

<p>While these are different, they are both valid. The trees both have cost 16. The MST of a graph will be unique, meaning there is only one, if none of the edges of the graph have the same weight.</p>

<h1>Traveling Salesperson</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txzR-tM6z7M">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPvOpQ6w734">YouTube Video</a></p>
<p>While we won&rsquo;t outline algorithms suited for solving the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), we will outline the premise of the problem. This problem was first posed in 1832, almost a two centuries ago, and is still quite prevalent. It is applicable to traveling routes, distribution networks, computer architecture and much more. The TSP is a seminal problem that has motivated many research breakthroughs, including Kruskals algorithm!</p>
<p>The motivation of the TSP is this: given a set of locations, what is the shortest path such that we can visit each location and end back where started?</p>
<p>Suppose we wanted to take a roadtrip with friends to every state capital in the continental US as well as Washington D.C. To save money and time, we would want to minimize the distance that we travel. Since we are taking a roadtrip, we would want to avoid frivolous driving. For example, if we start in Sacremento, CA we would not want to end the trip in Boston, MA. The trip should start and end at the same location for efficiency.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the shortest trip that visits each state capital and Washington D.C. once. In this example, we can start where ever we like and will end up where we started. 
<img src="../../images/9/7_TSP_TOUR.png" alt="Visit each state capital">^[PatriciaNeri, August 2018 https://communities.sas.com/t5/SAS-Communities-Library/What-is-the-shortest-tour-that-visits-only-once-the-48/ta-p/490231]</p>
<p>In this problem, it is easy to get overwhelmed by all of the possibilities. Since there are 49 cities to visit, there are over <code>6.2*10^60</code> possibilities. For reference, <code>10^12</code> is equivalent to one trillion! Thus, we need an algorithmic approach to solve this problem as opposed to a brute force method.</p>
