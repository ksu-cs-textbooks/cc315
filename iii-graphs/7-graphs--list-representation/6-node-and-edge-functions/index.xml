    <description>add node: will add a node to the graph with the given value if our graph still has room. Finding a location for the node will be the same procedure as the matrix graph. If we find an open spot to add the node, we will instantiate a new graph node and insert it into the nodes attribute. function ADDNODE(VALUE) IDX = -1 for NODE in NODES if NODE is VALUE return NODE&#39;s index if NODE has no entry and IDX is -1 IDX = NODE&#39;s index if IDX is not -1 NEWNODE = graph node with VALUE and IDX for input add NEWNODE to NODES at position IDX increment SIZE return IDX remove node: will remove a node to the graph with the given value if our graph has the node.</description>
