    <description>In this module, we introduced a new way to store the graph data structure. Thus, we now have two ways to work with graphs, in lists and in matrices:&#xA;List Representation Matrix Representation While these methods show the same information, there are cases when one way may be more desirable than the other.&#xA;We discussed how a sparse graph is better suited for a list representation and a dense graph is better suited for a matrix representation.</description>
